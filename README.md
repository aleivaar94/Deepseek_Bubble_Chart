ðŸ«§ Bubble charts all the way? DeepSeek, help me reason! 

Recently I have been replacing (some) grouped bar charts with bubble charts because they add a third variable to clearly show the differences in magnitude. 

I came across this grouped bar chart by Aymeric Roucher from Hugging Face that shows DeepSeek R1 outperforming the best proprietary LLMs. 

What are your thoughts on using a bubble chart instead to compare DeepSeek R1's performance against GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet across various benchmarks?
